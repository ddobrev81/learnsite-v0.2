==============

Fully operational pseudo-OOPHP code for my website

TODOS:

- Write my own user input validation/sanitation library. Maybe session handling too?
- Still have to write a blog and a forum (OOP implementation will be hard but nessesary)
- Make it fully OOPHP - will need classes for form processing and error checking
OR
- Rewrite it all using Zend Framework. That MVC switch will be hella hard.
